    "According to the [State Library of Iowa](https://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/collections/law-library/HistoricalFAQ/Q14), in 1934, Iowa state passed the \"Iowa Liquor Control Act\" which states that Iowa state assumed direct control over the wholesale and retail distribution of all alcoholic beverages except beer. This is followed by another reorganisation in 1986 whereby the Alcoholic Beverages Division's involvement with the liquor retail business came to an end. However, **the division still controls the wholesaling of liquor as well as the licensing and regulating of the state's alcoholic beverages industry until today.** \n",

This relationship suggested that I should perform feature engineering to transform pack into a categorical feature. Specifically, I would combine existing pack values into 6, 12, 24, 48 and others, then apply one-hot encoding to these 5 new categorical values. \n",
    "2. Similar to pack, **bottle_volume_ml** do not have a linear correlation. More common bottle size below 2 liters has greater demand than those larger than 2 liters. Therefore, I would also perform feature engineering to treat the bottle_volume_ml into a categorical feature. Specific rules will be examined below since the figure is too small to decipher. \n",
    "3. **state_bottle_cost** and **state_bottle_retail** showed very similar correlation to bottles_sold. The higher the cost or state retail price per bottle, the fewer bottles sold to retailers. Therefore, I would keep one as a feature and discard the other one. Between cost and retail price, I would opt to retain the state_bottle_retail since it would better reflect the quantity that retailers stock up.\n",
    "4. **sales_dollars** and **volume_sold_liters** also requires feature engineering to calculate historical values to avoid look-ahead bias. Specifically, I will experiment with a variety of historical calculations such as N-day cummulative figure, last week figure, last month figure to decide on which historical value has the best predictive power for future demand. \n",

    "**Stationary vs non-stationary time series**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationarity means that the statistical properties of a time series i.e. mean, variance and covariance do not change over time. A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed. Thus, time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary — the trend and seasonality will affect the value of the time series at different times. On the other hand, a white noise series is stationary — it does not matter when you observe it, it should look much the same at any point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications on demand forecasting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many statistical models require the series to be stationary to make effective and precise predictions. In general, a non-stationary time series cannot be forecasted using traditional time series models such as AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA). If the bottles_sold is non-stationary, I will have 2 options: \n",
    "- Option 1: Apply first differencing or logarithmic transform to make the time series stationary (i.e. remove the trend and seasonality)\n",
    "- Option 2: Choose other time series models that accommodate non-stationary time series such as AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). \n",
    "\n",
    "**2 approaches to test for stationarity**\n",
    "- Visual test to observe whether there is any trend or seasonality\n",
    "- Statistical hypothesis tests: also known as the unit root test\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common statistical hypothesis tests for stationarity**\n",
    "Common tests include Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test, Phillips-Perron Unit Root Tests and Kwiatkowski, Philips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS) test. Among them, KPSS is the most popular and  (a.k.a. the unit root test) - useful when it is difficult to tell based on visual test\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I want to assess the true stationarity of the time series, I will be using the visual test, the KPSS test and the ADF test with the level of significance of 0.05.
